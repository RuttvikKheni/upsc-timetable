üîé Working Professional: Now Let‚Äôs Recalculate Precisely
You correctly noted:

Weekdays (Mon‚ÄìSat): 3 hours/day

Sundays: 8 hours/day

So, 1 week = 6√ó3 + 1√ó8 = 26 hours/week

Now, how many full weeks in 240 days?

240 √∑ 7 = ~34.29 weeks
Which is: 34 full weeks + 2 remaining days

Now calculate total study hours:

34 weeks √ó 26 hrs/week = 884 hrs

Remaining 2 days (assume 1 weekday + 1 Sunday) ‚Üí 3 + 8 = 11 hrs

‚úÖ Total GS Hours Available = 884 + 11 = 895 hrs
